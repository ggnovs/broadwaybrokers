    <h2>Welcome to Broadway Brokers</h2>
    <p>Connecting clients with industry-leading financial and property brokerage services.</p>
    <h2>A Message about Upcoming Changes </h2>
    <p>I want to take this moment to speak with you directly. Broadway has grown and succeeded because of the incredible talent, dedication, and hard work each of you brings to this company, and I am truly grateful for everything you do.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>At the same time, our industry is going through significant changes, affecting many companies, including ours. We had hoped to manage through natural turnover. However, the pace of change in the market now requires us to take additional steps we had hoped to avoid. </p>
    <p>I know this is a challenging moment for all of us, and I want to acknowledge the contributions, commitment, and effort that everyone has brought to Broadway. We are committed to managing this transition with transparency and fairness, and to ensuring that everyone is treated with respect and receives the support they need throughout this process. </p>
    <p>Together, by supporting one another and focusing on our shared goals, we will navigate this transition successfully and continue to keep Broadway strong.  </p>
    <p>Thank you for everything that you do, and for the part you play in making Broadway the company it is. </p>
    <p>With appreciation,</p>
    <p>J. T. Carpenter </p>
    <p>President and CEO </p>
