    <h2>A Message about Upcoming Changes </h2>
    <p>❛❛ I want to speak with you directly about the changes we are making at Broadway. Like many companies in our industry, we are adapting to shifts in the market, and this includes difficult decisions such as office closures and staffing changes.</p>
    <p>I want to reassure you that your coverage, services, and support remain fully intact. Our teams continue to operate as normal, and the adjustments we are making are designed to strengthen our long-term stability and improve how we serve you.</p>
    <p>Thank you for everything that you do, and for the part you play in making Broadway the company it is. </p>
    <p>Thank you for trusting Broadway and for allowing us to continue supporting your needs through this transition. ❜❜</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">With appreciation,</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">J. T. Carpenter </p>
